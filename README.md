# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using The Machine Learning
This is Machine learning model which detect and prevent by fraudulent transaction made through credit and debit card.

# Abstract:

The use of online banking and credit card is increasing day by day. As the usage of credit/debit card or netbanking is increasing, the possibility of many fraud activities is also increasing. There are many incidents are happened in presently where because of lack of knowledge the credit card users are sharing their personal details, card details and one time password to a unknown fake call. And the result will be fraud happened with the account. Fraud is the problem that it is very difficult to trace the fraud person if he made call from a fake identity sim or call made by some internet services. So in this research some supervised methodologies and algorithms are used to detect fraud which gives approximate accurate results. The illegal or fraud activities put very negative impact on the business and customers loose trust on the company. It also affects the revenue and turnover of the company. In this research isolation forest algorithm is applied for classification to detect the fraud activities and the data sets are collected from the professional survey organizations.

# Content

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

# Problem Statement

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website and it has a total of 2,84,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.
